    - first of all i believe that this project need to some enhancements 

# Table of contents 
 ## Installation
 ## Usage
 

# Installation

    - just download the app and run it (I don't use any pods)
    
# Usage
    -  i decided MVVM architecture pattern to make some unCoupled between view and view model however there is some coupled  and depends on time also.

# Dissuasion 
    - the favorite section need more time to develop to store data local or get it from api 
    - the most part i like in the app when i create network layer without any pods (alamofire-Moya)
    - the app isn't ready to submit to app store , it need app icon, more testing,some data come from api (favorite and if this     play visited before)
    - no but i apologize about late
    - some things are missing like the behavior of store data if it store local or on running time
